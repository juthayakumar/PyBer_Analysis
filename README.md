# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, and then create a line graph that visualized the analysis. The ride data graph visualized the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Results
  Once the data was put together and merged, the data was charted to clearly state differences. The image below and multiline graph show this. The images show the differences amongst the different city types when comparing total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

  This image shows that the urban city type was different from the other two in the case that it had more total drivers than rides. This could be the reason why drivers here made less than in the other two city types, and the average fare per ride was lower as well.

  The line graph shows that there were some similarities as well. All city types appear to see a spike and rise to a peak before March, and we can see that it holds fairly steady for the Urban city type through April. All three see a drop right when March begins as well. 

## Summary
Three business recommendations for the CEO are:
  
  1) Rural cities appear to be more profitable when looking at the difference between average fare per driver and ride, so focus on the other two for profitability.
  2) There are many more drivers than rides in the urban city type, so reducing the number of drivers would be beneficial.
  3) The urban city type probably has a higher population than the other city types, so increasing advertising to promote ride sharing could be beneficial.
